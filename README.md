### File Structure:
1. Homework_3.ipynb: the main markdown file, containing the explanation of the high level code.
2. Classes.ipynb: the explanation of the classes we used to solve the tasks (this file is for illustration purpose only, not executable!).
3. Classes (folder): contains the classes .py files.
⋅⋅* hoohle.py: the python code of the classes (explained in the above file, Classes.ipynb)
4. style (folder): contains the css files used in the html presentation of our results.
5. data (folder): contains the TSV files (not uploaded to Github) but could be created by executing the code.
6. framework (folder): contains the saved index and framworks files.

### How to read our solutions?
1. First read the Homework_3.ipynb file which explains the main approach of our solution (maybe use a split screen with hoohle.py to follow the functions).
2. Then read the Classes.ipynb, which goes in details of our classes and functions.
3. And you can refer to the classes/hoohle.py for further information about the classes (but it has the code explained in classes.ipynb).
