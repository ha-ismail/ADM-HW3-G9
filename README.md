2. Classes.ipynb: the explanation of the classes we used to solve the tasks (this file is for illustration purpose only, not executable!).
3. Classes (folder): contains the classes .py files.
  a. hoohle.py: the python code of the classes (explained in the above file, Classes.ipynb)
4. style (folder): contains the css files used in the html presentation of our results.
5. data (folder): contains the TSV files.
6. framework (folder): contains the saved index and framworks files.

### How to read our solutions?

2. Then read the Classes.ipynb.
3. And refer to the classes/hoohle.py for further information about the classes.
