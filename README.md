### File Structure:
. Homework_3.ipynb: the main markdown file, containing the explanation of the high level code.
. Classes.ipynb: the explanation of the classes we used to solve the tasks (this file is for illustration purpose only, not executable!).
. Classes (folder): contains the classes .py files.
  . hoohle.py: the python code of the classes (explained in the above file, Classes.ipynb)
. style (folder): contains the css files used in the html presentation of our results.
. data (folder): contains the TSV files.
. framework (folder): contains the saved index and framworks files.

### How to read our solutions?
. First read the Homework_3.ipynb file (maybe use a split screen with hoohle.py to follow the functions).
. Then read the Classes.ipynb.
. And refer to the classes/hoohle.py for further information about the classes.
